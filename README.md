## Processing & Identity Verification

- We may request you to confirm the request from the same registered email address or provide limited verification to prevent unauthorized deletion.
- Standard processing time: **within 30 calendar days** (usually faster), unless extensions are needed due to complexity or legal constraints.

## Active Subscriptions

- If you purchased a subscription through the App Store / Google Play, you must cancel it separately in the respective store. Account deletion does **not** automatically cancel external billing.

## Backups & Technical Logs

- Data scheduled for deletion is removed from active systems first.
- Encrypted backups and rolling system logs may contain residual references until they naturally expire or are rotated (typical retention: up to 30–90 days). They are not actively accessed except for security/forensic purposes.

## AI / Analytical Content

- If AI‑powered features (e.g. chat or recommendation generation) produced anonymized or aggregated analytical artifacts, these are either deleted along with your account data or retained only in a form that cannot be linked back to you.

## Irreversibility

- After deletion completes, your account cannot be restored. You would need to register again to use MentoIQ.

## Legal / Compliance Exceptions

- We may retain minimal records strictly required for:
  - Fraud or abuse prevention
  - Charge dispute evidence
  - Financial transaction compliance
  - Security incident investigation
    These are isolated from normal application processing and purged once the lawful basis ends.
